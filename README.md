## PostgreSQL solutions for [SQL Practice Problems](https://sqlpracticeproblems.com/)

I have created a PostgreSQL version of the SQL Server scripts used in the book __SQL Practice Problems__ by __Sylvia Moestl Vasilik__.

Since PostgreSQL is free and its SQL dialect is considered to be the most standards-compliant of all relational database management systems (RDBMs), I thought it would be worth the effort to make the source and solution SQL scripts available for it.

## To use

You will need to create the PostgreSQL schema using the SQL script named __sql_practice_problems_pg__ in the source scripts folder of this repo.

I translated the SQL Server version to PostgreSQL equivalent and then created PostgreSQL solutions for each of the 57 problems in the book, see the three SQL script files located in the mysolutions folder of this repo.

To get maximum benefit from this using PostgreSQL, I recommend that:
- You get a copy of the book - it is available to purchase as either a PDF or a paper copy.
- Use the SQL script named above to create the PostgreSQL tables and populate them.
- Try to solve the problems on your own.
- If you're stuck, have a look at my solutions.

## To Do

- I will write up some more detailed note on the translation from SQL Server to PostgreSQL i
